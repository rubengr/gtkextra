 - The TIFF, PNG, and JPEG image loading libraries. You most
   likely have these installed on your system already. If not

    libtiff must be version 3.6.0 or higher.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GtkExtra mailing list. 
You will need to create an account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C and GTK libraries.

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  Please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. As a 
  last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software 
  that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to gtkextra.sourceforge. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GtkExtra programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
